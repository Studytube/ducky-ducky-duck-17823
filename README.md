# DevOps Engineer Interview - Code Review Exercise

Welcome! This repository contains code review snippets for a practical DevOps interview exercise.

## Exercise Overview

**Time:** 15 minutes total
**Format:** Code review discussion

You will review 3 short configuration snippets and discuss what you observe - both good practices and potential improvements.

## The Snippets

### 1. Dockerfile (`1-snippet-Dockerfile.docker`)
A Dockerfile for building a containerized Rails application for deployment to staging/production environments.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (choose one based on your familiarity)
- **Semaphore CI** (`2-snippet-Semaphore.yml`) - Primary option
- **GitHub Actions** (`2-snippet-GitHub-Actions.yml`) - Alternative option

A CI/CD pipeline that runs end-to-end tests and handles deployments.

### 3. Terraform Infrastructure (`3-snippet-Terraform.tf`)

## What We're Looking For

- **Security awareness**: Can you spot security issues?
- **Best practices**: Do you recognize industry-standard approaches?
- **Practical thinking**: Can you suggest concrete improvements?
- **Communication**: Can you explain your reasoning clearly?

## How to Approach This

1. Review each snippet as if a teammate submitted it for code review
2. Point out what you see - both good and areas for improvement
3. Suggest specific changes where applicable
4. Don't worry about being perfect - we're interested in your thought process!

## Tips

- Take about 5 minutes per snippet
- Start with what jumps out at you first
- Think about security, performance, and maintainability
- It's okay to ask clarifying questions

Good luck! 🚀
